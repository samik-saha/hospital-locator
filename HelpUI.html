            <p>Welcome to Hospital Locator! Here is a short help if you are lost.</p>
            <h3>Set your location</h3>
            <p>When you launch the app for the first time it will ask your permission for accessing the device location. You can grant the access to deny. 
            If you deny you can still use the app by entering your location.
            We recommend that you grant access to the app to access your location, so that it can detect your location automatically.
            </p>
            <p>You can adjust your location in the map by dragging the marker. Also, you can search for another location by using the search box.</p>
            <p>Once your are sure your location is correct click the continue button.</p>
            <h3>Browse Hospitals</h3>
            <p>Once the search is over, you are shown a list of hospitals that are found within a 5 km radius of your location. You can change a radius with the change radius command in the AppBar (swipe from bottom to access the AppBar)</p>
            <p>You can search for an hospital within the results using the searchbox</p>
            <p>Now, if you get more details about a hospital click or tap the item on the list.</p>
            <h3>Visit a hospital</h3>
            <p>Once you select a hospital from the list, a new page is opened with the hospital details like, pictures, rating, phone no., website, address, map, direction and reviews.</p>
